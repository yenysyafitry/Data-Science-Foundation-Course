 A You will always have test error zero
 B You can not have test error zero
 C None of these
 D Both A and B
```
<details>

 A The polynomial degree
 B Whether we learn the weights by matrix inversion or gradient descent.
 C The use of a constant-term.
 D None of the above.
```
<details>
<summary markdown="span">Answer :</summary>

 A Ridge regression
 B Lasso
 C Both Ridge and Lasso
 D None of both

22 Which of the following options is true regarding “Regression” and “Correlation”? Note: y is the dependent variable and x is an independent variable.
 A The relationship is symmetric between x and y in both.
 B The relationship is not symmetric between x and y in both.
 C The relationship is not symmetric between x and y in case of correlation but in case of regression it is symmetric.
 D The relationship is symmetric between x and y in case of correlation but in case of regression it is not symmetric.
```
<details>
<summary markdown="span">Answer :</summary>
D The relationship is symmetric between x and y in case of correlation but in case of regression it is not symmetric.</br>because  </br>Correlation is a statistic metric that measures the linear association between two variables. It treats y and x symmetrically. Regression is a set up to predict y from x. The relationship is not symmetric.

23 Which of the following is true about “Ridge” or “Lasso” regression methods in case of feature selection?
 A Ridge regression uses subset selection of features.
 B Lasso regression uses subset selection of features.
 C Both use subset selection of features.
 D None of above
```
<details>
<summary markdown="span">Answer :</summary>
B Lasso regression uses subset selection of features.</br>because  </br>“Ridge regression” will use all predictors in the final model whereas “Lasso regression” can be used for feature selection because coefficient values can be zero.

 A Linear Regression with varying error terms.
 B Linear Regression with constant error terms.
 C Linear Regression with zero error terms.
 D None of these.
